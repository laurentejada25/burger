# burger

This app uses Node, Express and Handlebars to run.

An ORM is used to create CRUD functionalities Read, Update, and Create to create the interactive app. 

The user can post new burger options using the Create method which displays to mySQL and the html page using handlebars. 

Users are able to "devour" the burgers by clicking the "eat me" button which updates the devour boolean in mySQL, updates the data on the page and displays it on the other side of the screen.
